This is a bodge for applications that refuse to comply with the XDG
Base Directory Specification
https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html,
but we still need in some way.

Generally this involves creating some additional environment variables, but for
some reason or another it is not possible for the following programs:

 * bash
   Unless invoked with a command-line argument, bash always looks for its
   configuraion in ~/.bashrc
   To compensate, we use this file to source the file at the correct location,
   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bash/bashrc
