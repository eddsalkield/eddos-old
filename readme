To install, clone the repository into your $XDG_CONFIG_HOME,
and run ./install.sh

Equivalently:
```
sudo dnf install git
mkdir -p "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"
cd "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"
git clone https://github.com/eddsalkield/eddos.git
cd eddos
./install.sh
```

The script above requires an internet connection.  If you have installed Fedora
minimal, you might need to connect to wifi using only nmcli.
