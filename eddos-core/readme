eddos-core installs the base set of command-line only programs required for the
system, alongside configuration where relevant.

SHELL

eddos currently supports the following shells:
 * bash

Shell configuration in eddos is performed in the shell directories:
 * $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/shell (for user configuration)
 * $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/eddos-shell (default configuration - do not touch!)
Each of these shell directories has subdirectories for aliases, environment
variables, and modifications to $PATH.  Splitting the configuration of the shell
this way allows settings to be preserved across all POSIX-compliant shells,
and makes your configurations more modularisable!

Specific shell configurations can be found in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/name-of-shell,
for any of the supported shells.


TERMINAL MULTIPLEXER
eddos uses tmux for terminal multiplexing.  It is configurable at
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux/config


TEXT EDITOR
neovim is the default text editor.  It is configurable at
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/init.vim
